			<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Sustainability</h2>
			
			<p class="sectionContent">
				This year, I've actually learned some things about sustainability, especially since I've been in the
				dark of news.
				For example, 20% of the world's largest companies set a 2050 goal of net-zero emissions. This is great,
				just that some
				companies at least are not going to follow through in this goal.
			</p>
			<p class="sectionContent">
				Between that and the Play Pumps, it's clear how humans usually deal with things before having a solid
				plan set in stone.

			<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Health</h2>
			
			<p class="sectionContent">
				I've always wanted to go to Switzerland for their beautiful landscape, but knowing they have some of the
				best healthcare in the world is a nice thing to add to the list. Even non-residents have to have some
				provider by their 3rd month there. It's a universal system, but not paid for by taxes, rather, the
				individual. This is nice to know since I might eventually consider moving there, provided the political
				atmosphere isn't as toxic as the United States.

			<p class="sectionContent">
				Seems like there's plenty of Software Engineering jobs too :)

			<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Security</h2>
			
			<p class="sectionContent">
				Back on the topic of security, I learned about a security system for Andriod apps that uses Natual
				Language Proccessing to analyze coding patterns and detect malicious code before it is compiled. This is
				especially prevalent to me, as I have several Andriod devices, including my phone, reading tablet, TV,
				and VR headset.

			<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Joy of Living</h2>
			
			<p class="sectionContent">
				Previously, I had never actually consciously thought of ways to improve the way of life. Normally it's
				always been something that comes to mind as I go about things. Thinking of it now, it's quite ironic to
				try and think of ways to improve living when you can't even appreciate it in the first place. I have,
				however, thought of some neat ideas for Arduino projects and 3D prints to make through talking to
				my friends about things that could possibly improve.
