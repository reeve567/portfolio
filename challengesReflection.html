						Perspectives on Grand Challenges for Engineering
					</h2>

					<p class="sectionContent">
						This semester, I took a course called `Perspectives on
						Grand Challenges for Engineering,` which covered the
						<a href="engineeringChallenges.html">main challenges</a>
						faced in engineering. We did some research in each of
						the areas, and looked at some previous projects that
						have attempted these challenges (The Play Pump, for
						one). The main challenges that I found interesting were
						Joy of Living and Health. Because of my struggles with
						mental health, finding the joy in life can sometimes be
						very difficult. While I was working on an assignment on
						Joy of Living, I was extremely excited for the future
						that could await us, and yet, days later I saw the
						Metaspace talk. To say the least, I'm somewhat worried
						the future I'm looking forward to might not be what I
						imagine.

						Impact of Current Efforts to Solve Global Challenges
					</h2>

					<p class="sectionContent">
						This was a really fun project to work on, and is part of
						what I referenced above. My topic was Joy of Living, and
						I did a lot of research on Virtual Reality and Natrual
						Language Proccessing. These could both possibly be huge
						parts of our future, and at present, they're kind of in
						the background. Work has been done for years now on both
						topics, and they are both still getting new techniques
						and research added to their inventory. What I was
						looking into was how these could be implemented in our
						lives, and how they might impact what we do in the
						future.

					<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Future Solutions</h2>

					<p class="sectionContent">
						The Future Solutions project was one that required us to
						be inventive, to come up with some kind of technology
						for the future. The solution identified was a data
						transmitter that used Quantum Entanglement to send data,
						rather than the internet. The main impact this would
						have at first is near instantaneous transfer of data
						across the world. Primarily for businesses, this would
						help keep peace of mind with security of important
						documents and data collected from users. If we
						eventually encode life into data, then we could almost
						transmit ourselves anywhere, instantly. My main takeaway
						from this project was how creative I can get when
						prompted, especially when it came down to coming up with
						a character that uses the device.
