					Hi! I'm a student studying the field of software engineering
					and I have a passion for making things. Whether it’s: a
					utility program to sort my indie games found scattered
					across the internet, a bot that tracks my Skyblock coin
					balance, or making cool looking graphs in Minecraft, I am
					always teaching myself something new and learning more. A
					more recent project I have been working on is a turret that
					I am designing from scratch using Autodesk software, a 3D
					printer, some simple soldering, and C++.
				</p>
				<p>
					I started playing the online gaming platform, Roblox, 11
					years ago, at the start of 2010. This was when my love for
					sandbox games first began. Although I mainly just played
					other player’s games at the time, it was still tons of fun
					to load up other people’s models and scripts and mess around
					on occasion. During 2011, I stumbled across a few inspiring
					Minecraft building timelapse videos. The main channel I
					watched was FyreUK, and I was fascinated with the idea of
					being able to pick up anything and place it anywhere else.
					This, plus the fact that there was a generated landscape to
					build on changed everything for me. A video of a Dwarven
					city built on the side of a cliff convinced me to finally
					get the game, and that’s when I fell down the rabbit hole.
					Minecraft has been a game that I have always come back to.
				</p>
				<p>
					I didn’t learn to code until later on, but that didn’t stop
					me from loving the freedom plugins allowed me to have on a
					Bukkit server. This led me to make a long line of servers
					which gradually got better over the course of 9 years, until
					it reached the point where I started to create all the
					plugins I needed by my own hand. My most successful server
					was one of the last ones I made, which was around 4 years
					ago. On
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CVdCgireY4"
						>this</a
					>
					server, I shared ownership with two other friends, but I
					solely developed while they used their Youtube following to
					promote the server. For the duration that it lasted, we had
					an active player base of around 20 players concurrently
					during most times of the day. I really enjoyed closely
					interacting with the community (<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYGJIKZB4ic"
						>my favorite event</a
					>), and to this day some of the former players still message
					me occasionally to chat.

						I play a lot of different games. 267 on Steam, 161 on
						Epic Games, and 198 without an organizer. Of course,
						some of them I haven't gotten around to, and some have
						hardly any play time. But luckily, on Steam and Epic
						Games, I can keep track of my whole library easily. This
						isn't true for those indie games whose playerbase
						consists of a handful of players, though. These games
						have to either be on itch.io, or they are just hosted
						somewhere on the internet. That's where my little
						program comes in, sorting their downloads and
						information. I created this with one website in mind
						that I mainly go to, but there's masked download links
						and all that jazz, so here we are.

						This project has gone through many iterations, but the
						main two versions are TornadoFX (JavaFX with Kotlin
						extensions), Dear ImGui (C++ -&gt Kotlin library). The
						original point was to organize my different games into
						an easily navigatable file structure, but then I was
						having fun and ended up with UI. The difficult part was
						to also include the different versions of games into the
						same folders, and to include the most common types of
						compression. In order to figure out what zip files were
						of the same game, I looked for the executable of the
						game and named it based off that (provided there wasn't
						a generic name).

						Although it was a short project, this one was one of my
						latest favorites cause it was a lot of fun to play
						around with. This plugin allows you to create 3D graphs
						in-game using particles. The idea came after my Calculus
						III class one day, since I realized I could make almost
						any shape if I just chained them together. At present,
						the plugin only supports one graph at a time, but it'd
						be pretty trivial to add in more.

						The airsoft turret is still a work in progress, but has
						been a labor of love (mentally and financially). The
						idea is to create an airsoft weapon capable of operating
						automatically, as well as manually. The controls are
						through my laptop, just using the arrow keys to turn and
						the spacebar to shoot. The range of motion is 360
						degrees, however the current limitation is the central
						power cord getting wound up. This can be solved in a few
						ways, but finding one that works best for my budget and
						limited knowledge of mechanical design is very
						difficult. The whole thing runs on a Arduino Uno, uses 4
						motors to move & shoot, has 2 cameras, and a lidar range
						finder.
