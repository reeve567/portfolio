					Hi! I'm a student studying Software Engineering with a
					passion for making things. Whether it's a utility program to
					sort my indie games found scattered across the internet; a
					bot that tracks my Skyblock coin balance; cool looking
					graphs in Minecraft; or a turret designed from scratch, 3D
					printed, wired together, and programmed to fire Airsoft BBs;
					I am always teaching myself something new and learning more.
				</p>
				<p>
					It was 11 years ago that I started playing Roblox. This was
					the start of my love for sandbox games. Although I mainly
					just played other player’s games at the time, it was still
					tons of fun to load up other people’s models and scripts and
					mess around on occasion. During 2011, I stumbled across a
					few Minecraft building timelapse videos. The main channel I
					watched was FyreUK, and the idea of being able to pick up
					anything and place it anywhere else was awesome, plus the
					fact that there was landscape to work with changed
					everything for me. A video of a Dwarven city built on the
					side of a cliff convinced me to finally get the game, and
					that’s when I fell down the rabbit hole.
				</p>
				<p>
					Learning to code didn’t come till later on, but that didn’t
					stop me from loving the freedom plugins allowed you to have
					on a Bukkit server. This started a long line of servers I
					made that continuously got better and better, until the
					point where I started to just code all the plugins I needed.
					The biggest success of these servers was one of the last
					ones I did, called
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CVdCgireY4"
						>Mudkip Prison</a
					>, around 4 years ago. I was the sole developer (there were
					very few custom plugins for this one), and my two Youtuber
					friends were the public owners. Over the summer that we ran
					it, we had an active player base of around 20 players
					concurrently during most times of the day. It was a ton of
					fun to interact with the community closely (<a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYGJIKZB4ic"
						>my favorite event</a
					>), and years later some of the players still message me on
					occasion to chat.

						I play a lot of different games. 267 on Steam, 161 on
						Epic Games, and 198 without an organizer. Of course,
						some of them I haven't gotten around to, and some have
						hardly any play time. But luckily, on Steam and Epic
						Games, I can keep track of my whole library easily. This
						isn't true for those indie games whose playerbase
						consists of a handful of players, though. These games
						have to either be on itch.io, or they are just hosted
						somewhere on the internet. That's where my little
						program comes in, sorting their downloads and
						information. I created this with one website in mind
						that I mainly go to, but there's masked download links
						and all that jazz, so here we are.

						This project has gone through many iterations, but the
						main two versions are TornadoFX (JavaFX with Kotlin
						extensions), Dear ImGui (C++ -&gt Kotlin library). The
						original point was to organize my different games into
						an easily navigatable file structure, but then I was
						having fun and ended up with UI. The difficult part was
						to also include the different versions of games into the
						same folders, and to include the most common types of
						compression. In order to figure out what zip files were
						of the same game, I looked for the executable of the
						game and named it based off that (provided there wasn't
						a generic name).

						Although it was a short project, this one was one of my
						latest favorites cause it was a lot of fun to play
						around with. This plugin allows you to create 3D graphs
						in-game using particles. The idea came after my Calculus
						III class one day, since I realized I could make almost
						any shape if I just chained them together. At present,
						the plugin only supports one graph at a time, but it'd
						be pretty trivial to add in more.

						The airsoft turret is still a work in progress, but has
						been a labor of love (mentally and financially). The
						idea is to create an airsoft weapon capable of operating
						automatically, as well as manually. The controls are
						through my laptop, just using the arrow keys to turn and
						the spacebar to shoot. The range of motion is 360
						degrees, however the current limitation is the central
						power cord getting wound up. This can be solved in a few
						ways, but finding one that works best for my budget and
						limited knowledge of mechanical design is very
						difficult. The whole thing runs on a Arduino Uno, uses 4
						motors to move & shoot, has 2 cameras, and a lidar range
						finder.
