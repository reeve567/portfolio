				<p>
					Hi! I'm a University student studying Software Engineering
					with a passion for making things. Whether it's a utility
					program for myself or just something fun to use, there's
					always some kind of fun problems to solve.
				</p>
				<p>
					It wasn't until I started playing Roblox that I realized I
					really love to make things, but it wasn't until I started
					playing Minecraft 8 years ago that I really got into it. It
					all started with a server on 1.2.5 for my friends and I to
					play on, but my favorite part quickly became the plugins.
					There was so much you could do in this crazy sandbox by just
					adding a few more files to the server, from explosive arrows
					to full chess games.

						I play a lot of different games. 267 on Steam, 161 on
						Epic Games, and 198 without a launcher. Of course, some
						of them I haven't gotten around to, and some have hardly
						any play time. But luckily, on Steam and Epic Games, I
						can keep track of my whole library easily. This isn't
						true for those indie games whose playerbase consists of
						a handful of players, though. These games have to either
						be on itch.io, or they are just hosted somewhere on the
						internet. That's where my little program comes in,
						sorting their downloads and information. I created this
						with one website in mind that I mainly go to, but
						there's masked download links and all that jazz, so here
						we are.

						This project has gone through many iterations, but the
						main two versions are TornadoFX (JavaFX with Kotlin
						extensions), Dear ImGui (C++ -&gt Kotlin library). The
						original point was to organize my different games into
						an easily navigatable file structure, but then I was
						having fun and ended up with UI. The difficult part was
						to also include the different versions of games into the
						same folders, and to include the most common types of
						compression. In order to figure out what zip files were
						of the same game, I looked for the executable of the
						game and named it based off that (provided there wasn't
						a generic name).

						Although it was a short project, this one was one of my
						latest favorites cause it was a lot of fun to play
						around with. This plugin allows you to create 3D graphs
						in-game using particles. The idea came after my Calculus
						III class one day, since I realized I could make almost
						any shape if I just chained them together. At present,
						the plugin only supports one graph at a time, but it'd
						be pretty trivial to add in more.

					<h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Airsoft Turret</h2>

						January, 2021 - Present
					</h3>
					<p class="sectionContent">
						The airsoft turret is still a work in progress, but has
						been a labor of love (mentally and financially). The
						idea is to create an airsoft weapon capable of operating
						automatically, as well as manually. The controls are
						through my laptop, just using the arrow keys to turn and
						the spacebar to shoot. The range of motion is 360
						degrees, however the current limitation is the central
						power cord getting wound up. This can be solved in a few
						ways, but finding one that works best for my budget and
						limited knowledge of mechanical design is very
						difficult. The whole thing runs on a Arduino Uno, uses 4
						motors to move & shoot, has 2 cameras, and a lidar range
						finder.
